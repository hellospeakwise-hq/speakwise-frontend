 7. Risks and Mitigations
1. Low Feedback Participation:
   - Risk: Attendees may not submit feedback.
   - Mitigation: Simplify feedback form; send post-event reminders.
2. Verification Issues:
   - Risk: Inaccurate attendance lists or verification failures.
   - Mitigation: Allow manual proof submission; provide organizer support.
3. Speaker Value Perception:
   - Risk: Speakers may not see value in profiles.
   - Mitigation: Highlight traction metrics and booking opportunities.
4. Anonymity Concerns:
   - Risk: Attendees may fear feedback isn’t anonymous.
   - Mitigation: Clearly communicate anonymity; ensure robust data protection.

 8. Additional Notes
- Anonymity Emphasis: Reinforce in UI and messaging that feedback is anonymous to encourage honest responses.
- Speaker Traction: Consider a visible “Traction Score” (e.g., based on feedback volume and ratings) to gamify engagement.
- Public Profiles: Design profiles to be professional and shareable, like a LinkedIn for speakers.
- Virtual Events: Future iterations could include verification for virtual attendees (e.g., YouTube watch time or event codes).
